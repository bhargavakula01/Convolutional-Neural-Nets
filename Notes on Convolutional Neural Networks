Notes on Convolutional Neural Networks

WHAT ARE CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK:
- Allows one to work with more complex data, as regular(fully connected) neural networks are usually inefficient with large amount of data
- good when working with images and sounds


COMPONENTS OF CNN(CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS)
- filters: basically scan data and look for specific features that they are trained to look for
    - filter size: the length of each filter(which is a squre shape)
    - filter/kernal stride: number of pixel shifts over the input matrix
    - each pixel within the filter will have a different weight but the filter will have the same bias(within each forward and backward propagation, these don't change)
        - calculations : overall weight = r_Val * weight + g_Val * weight + b_Val * weight
            - all all the overal weights within the filter and then summed up into 1 number per filter
- pooling: reduces the dimentionality of the filter/kernal. Only when filters are pooled together is when the neural net able to detect larger features in a particular image
- zero padding: adding pixel with value of 0 around the ends of the image(for the Convolutional neural networks)
    - allows for even search of the image by kernals/filters

- depth in a convoltional layer is the number of filters that a particular convolutional layer has

How to calculate the output dimension of the CNN: W1 = ((W2 - f + 2p) / S)+1
    - W1: output dimension <-- this number is your length and the width of the dimentions. The depth is the number of filters in each convoltional layer.
    - W2: input dimension
    - f: receptive field(size of filter)
    - p: zero padding
    - S: kernal/filter stride
